  error: Multiple top-level modules discovered in a flat-layout: ['config', 'webservice'].
  
  To avoid accidental inclusion of unwanted files or directories,
  setuptools will not proceed with this build.
  
  If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple modules
  on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
  Instead, consider the following options:
  
  1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
  2. use a `src-layout`
  3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names
  
  To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.
