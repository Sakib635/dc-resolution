  The 'sklearn' PyPI package is deprecated, use 'scikit-learn'
  rather than 'sklearn' for pip commands.
  
  Here is how to fix this error in the main use cases:
  - use 'pip install scikit-learn' rather than 'pip install sklearn'
  - replace 'sklearn' by 'scikit-learn' in your pip requirements files
    (requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg, Pipfile, etc ...)
  - if the 'sklearn' package is used by one of your dependencies,
    it would be great if you take some time to track which package uses
    'sklearn' instead of 'scikit-learn' and report it to their issue tracker
  - as a last resort, set the environment variable
    SKLEARN_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_SKLEARN_PACKAGE_INSTALL=True to avoid this error
