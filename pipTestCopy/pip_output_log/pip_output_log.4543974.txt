INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of trigger to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested Twisted==20.3.0
    trigger 1.6.0 depends on Twisted<17.0.0 and >=15.5.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: Cannot install -r D:/Windsor/WindsorThesis/Git repo/Thesis-Project-Python-Dependency-Conflict-Resolution/Dataset/gist/main_gist\requirements.4543974.txt (line 1) and Twisted==20.3.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
